# About the Project

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds by Udacity. The tests are added using Jasmine to check the functionalites of the code written.

## Why this Project?

It's an important skill to have! Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass. *And this will be my task for this project!*


## What I have learned?

I have learned how Jasmine works and has its own distinct syntax and keywords, such as describes, it, and expects, just to name a few. Using this in combination with a few new methods, I learned how to perform conditional testing on a pre-existing application. This project also had us work through the testing of event handling and asynchronous operations.
